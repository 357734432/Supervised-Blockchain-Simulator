## Running the simulator

Before you run the simulator, you can access the configuration file *InputsConfig.py* to choose the model of interest (Base Model 0, Bitcoin Model 1 and Ethereum Model 2) and to set up the related parameters.
The parameters include the number of nodes (and their fraction of hash power), the block interval time, the block propagation delays, the block and transaction sizes, the block rewards, the tranaction fees etc.
Each model has a slightly different (or additional) parameters to capture it.

To run the simulator, one needs to trigger the main class *Main.py* either from the command line
> python Main.py

or using any Python editor such as Spyder.
